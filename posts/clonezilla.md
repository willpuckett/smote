Not exactly iOS related, but just used this for a client and it's worth a
mention.

[Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/) is an awesome little tool for disk,
partition, or image cloning.

Instructions for setup on Windows and GNU/Linux are
[here](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live.php). There's also a great guide
for creating a bootable USB on OS X
[here](https://riptutorial.com/operating-system/example/27118/install-the-popular-clonezilla-to-clone-a-mac-os-hard-drive--basic-usage-).
