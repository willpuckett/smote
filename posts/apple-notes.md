iOS 13 has yielded many beautiful and welcomed additions to life on the iPad. One of my favorite has been the ability to take screenshots of a full page. This can be fantastic for logging things on websites that may change or be inconsistent at a later date (for posterity's sake), and when I put the whole thing in Notes, it becomes searchable.

Unfortunately, Apple Notes is a little quirky about what it's willing to handle in the share sheet, and is especially picky about (AKA won't take) PDFs.

For a while, I was taking the full page screenshot ( **Power + VolUp** or drag the pencil from a bottom corner straight up), then using the Share Sheet to copy the PDF to the clipboard, then opening Apple Notes and pasting the PDF into a new note. Of course I couldn't live this way for long I was itching every time I had to go through the routine, just waiting for a fix... That never came...

So finally today I stopped whining and made a shortcut to deal with it. It takes all of about 14 seconds to create. 

First, create a new shortcut. Name it something memorable, then select **Shortcut Input** as the option for **Create note with**.

Next, hit the **...** next to your note title, and tick on **Show in Share Sheet**, tick off **Show in Widget**, and under **Share Sheet Types** select only **PDF**. Hit **Done** and then **Done** again.

Guess what? You're done. That's all it took.

If you don't feel like going through all of that, you can use [this link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/43a23a0d2cfb4d8fa0b2bbc40eead342) and it should open right up for you.
