Reading is expensive, at least it *can* be. Through the years, I've developed a pecking order for books and other media in order to help defray the costs of heavy consumption. 

I was a user of Overdrive, but it's been rebranded into [Libby, by OverDrive, Inc.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606?mt=8), the hip, slick, pony-tail-slinging younger sister. Having Libby at the top of the pecking order helps me save a substantial amount from month to month. Not to mention I just feel better about seeking knowledge distribution from a civic entity than the largest multinational corporation in existence, but that's probably just me....

Libby also works great with Apple's **Speak Screen**,[^1] so you can keep car/gym/bike time productive. You may be flying in the face of Einstein's wisdom, but at least you'll be flying.



[^1]: **Settings > General > Accessibility > Speech** and turn on **Speak Screen**. Now you can go to Libby/iBooks/Kindle, open the book you’d like to have narrated, and, using two fingers together, slide down from the top of the screen, like you’re accessing your notifications but with two fingers together.
