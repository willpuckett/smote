Fingers are great and, if I'm lucky, I'll always have them with me. But
sometimes I want to either have a little more precise interaction with the
screen on my iPad or maybe just not have to make such exaggerated motions with
my hand. Sometimes I want to lay in bed on Sunday morning reading the newspaper
on my iPad and scroll between articles with little more than the most minimal
movement.

I started with the [New Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/). Some
people call the new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil 2 because it's different from
the old one that used to have to plug in. But make no mistake, this #2 pencil is
#1 in usability. The Apple Pencil feels nice in my hand. It's pretty light,
without being _too_ light. It magnetizes to the side of the iPad to charge and
hopefully not get lost.

It's **GREAT** for writing. I use it for journal entries in notes, and to draw
[precision figures](https://theminitimemachine.org/portfolio/on-point-sculptures-on-the-tips-of-lead-pencils/).
I find mine to be pretty slippery on the screen, but I borrowed my buddy's one
day when he was over and realized his had a lot more friction against the glass.
I'm not sure if that's just from the way we use our pencils differently, or if
there's some variability in manufacture. The tip is replaceable on the pencils
(it unscrews) and can be replaced.

When I'm drawing and writing detail I definitely reach for my Apple Pencil
first. The Apple Pencil is great in the context of content, _but_ (you could
hear it coming, couldn't you?), it doesn't work at all in the OS context. It
can't switch apps, pull up the dock, open the control center, or resize multiple
windows (all covered in the [multitasking post](/multitasking)). These are the
things that compromise a lot of my interaction with the iPad when I'm relaxing
and reading, surfing the web, or shopping. Even the back/forward gestures in
Safari won't work with the Apple Pencil.

I shopped around and tried several options, but I'm the happiest with the
[Pencil by 53 in _Walnut_](https://www.amazon.com/FiftyThree-53PW06-Pencil-Digital-Stylus/dp/B01K5FE41A).
I would have linked to their site, but I _think_ it's been discontinued from
their site and is only available on Amazon/eBay/etc.

Of all the Styli I've tried in the past two months, the 53 one is heaven. It
moves comfortably across my screen with just the right amount of resistance. It
works with all of the multitasking gestures I use in my day-to-day workflows.
And the carpenter pencil shape is genius. It doesn't slide out of my hand. It's
also quite a bit longer than some other styli, which I find useful terrifically
useful. I almost never use it with the 53 Paper app, and don't really need the
Bluetooth eraser function, but the form factor is so compelling its worth the
extra cost. As if my accolades weren't enough, here's a video of someone else
who loves it a lot too:

People _love_ this pencil!

Anyway, if you feel like dumping a couple hundred dollars on battery operated
pieces of plastic, get these two pencils. You'll get a lot of mileage, that is
if you don't loose them. (They're _very_ easy to loose.)
