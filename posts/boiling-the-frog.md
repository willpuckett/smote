Ever tried boiling a frog? Legend has it that if you attempt to put the frog in boiling water, it senses the danger and jumps out, but if you put it in cool water and heat it slowly, it never perceives its pending demise.

I like to make the most of my time in transit, so I try and get as much content in as possible. I achieve this by listing to my podcasts at 2.5-3x depending on the syntax and diction of the host. Most people throw their hands up in the air when I suggest they try it. But it's like cooking the frog: start at 1.15x for a week or so, then move up to 1.5x for a couple of weeks, 2x for a few weeks, etc... Until you've cooked your own brain with content! Remember, you can always slow down and relisten to a section of particular interest, but really maximizing time in transit has proven to be a really stimulating life hack.

I use [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857?mt=8) as my preferred podcatcher. It lets you not only control the playback speed, but set different speeds for different podcasts if you like. It also allows taking a note at a specific time in the podcast, which is great for tagging interesting/useful information on the go, then returning to process it when back at my desk.

So... Ribbit ribbit ribb............


NOTE: No frogs were harmed in the making of this post.
