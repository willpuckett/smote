A couple of months ago, I got really fixated on getting a contact mic by
[Michael Krzyzaniak](https://michaelkrzyzaniak.com/). He makes a batch every so
often, so I set a reminder to periodically check his website so I could try and
catch one while he had them in stock.

As you can imagine, I was agonizing after repeatedly checking once a week for
the piezo. It was time to automate.

[Visualping.io](https://visualping.io) allows you to graphically track changes
to a webpage, and will notify you when those changes occur. I was able to plug
in Michael's [shop page](https://michaelkrzyzaniak.com/marshmallow/shop.php) and
then get an email when the **Out of Stock** buttons changed to **Add to Cart**.

This of coursed saved me oodles of time. May the full force of the event driven
web be with you!
