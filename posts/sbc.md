The world of single board computing is alive right now. Like Julie Andrews
spinning on a grassy hilltop, if you're willing to go down the rabbit hole,
you'll might come out singing. The 'chip shortage' of the past few years has
left many people (myself included) a lot more
[willing to experiment](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/you-cant-buy-raspberry-pi-right-now)
than they might otherwise have been. Internet sentiment evidences a community
that is a strange mix of excited, annoyed (the comments on
[this article](https://jamesachambers.com/radxa-zero-debian-ssd-boot-guide/)),
and somewhat unsettled. I can't wait to see what another year or two brings as
people respond to _what's going on_ in this space.

Over the past couple of months, I've been making upgrades that are a couple of
years old. There's no front page news here‚Äîit's largely just that some things
have come down a lot in costs (despite the general trend) and I needed a few new
machines‚Äîbut I thought it would be useful to collect and share my thoughts both
for my own reference later and in the event that my traversal proves at all
helpful for others grappling with similar decisions. Even with all the
excitement, for me, the best sbc is still the one I can avoid purchasing,
installing, and don't have to maintain. But for tasks that _have_ to run
locally, the rapidly improving state of affairs is much appreciated.

## The Need for...

In terms of processor speed, I wish I had run across a project called
[sbc-bench](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/master/Results.md)
much earlier. It's thorough listing of benchmarks was incredibly useful for me
as I started exploring rpi alternatives. It also has a listing of results
[sorted by speed](https://github.com/ThomasKaiser/sbc-bench/blob/master/results/Sorted-Results.md)
that can simplify comparisons, depending on what information you're seeking. The
a1.xlarge and M1 benchmarks really helped make the numbers relatable. I tend,
like most people, I imagine, to want continuously more capable things in
successively smaller packages. To that end, I wish it included information about
the form factor of each board, but that in no way takes away from the excellent
utility sbc-bench already provides, it's just me being lazy.

## NVMe

My constant pain/gripe point with sbc's is of course their speed. As I tried to
reflect more deeply on this, I realized that it wasn't so much the speed that my
projects ran at (I was very happy using Klipper on a pi zero 2 for instance),
but the speed at which my admin tasks ran. Taking several minutes to complete
system updates, or even just to image the sd as I'm getting started with a new
machine all felt like such a drag, and made me less productive. Essentially, I
was running into a wall with disk I/O bound tasks.

In the past I had experimented with using usb thumb drives, but didn't really
like leaving them hanging out of the pis. Their performance also tended to
degrade with longer running tasks as they didn't dissipate heat well. I don't
remember how I happened onto it this summer, but perhaps the biggest advance for
me was exploring some newer drives for rpi. I had been testing a 1tb NVMe drive
in a ssd enclosure which had to be connected via a powered hub, and I was
enamored with the **order of magnitude** boost in disk bound tasks. It made my
sbc start to feel like something I had never expected from it before: a _real_
computer.

Naturally, I had to get rid of the hub. James Chambers, who's writing is
essential reading for any one in the sbc space if you haven't happened onto it
already, wrote an awesome piece that proved very useful for me:
[Best Working SSD / Storage Adapters for Raspberry Pi 4 / 400](https://jamesachambers.com/best-ssd-storage-adapters-for-raspberry-pi-4-400/).
I switched to an Orico GV100 NVMe SSD drive which the pi had no problems booting
and operating via USB. It wasn't the cheapest drive, but I hastily thought it
was perfect and bought a couple of them for my printers. I then made the mistake
of continuing reading.

I had never worked with the CM4 before, but when I discovered it exposed the
PCIe lane and could more than double the disk I/O speed of the drives I had been
testing, I was interested. In the past when I had looked at the compute modules,
I had been put off by what seemed somehow more complicated, as well as the high
prices both of the modules and
[requsite carrier boards](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/project/raspberry-pi-cm4-pci-express-device-database)
such as the [tofu](https://store.oratek.com/products/tofu). As I tottered along
in my traversal of all things modern pi, I happened on the
[WaveShare Mini Base Board (A)](https://www.waveshare.com/product/cm4-io-base-a.htm).
At just under $20 bucks, I was willing to try one, but I didn't think I'd be
able to locate a reasonably priced CM4. Imagine my surprise when I found a 2gig
CM4 on the WaveShare site itself‚ÄîI was able to order the Base Board and the CM4
in a single purchase. Once they arrived I excitedly wanted to test them. The
Mini Base Board only takes 2242 and 2230 drives, however, so I couldn't throw my
2280 1tb drive in it (or use a 2242 drive with modules on both side due to the
2230 mount). I was past the return window on the Orico drives so I decided to
take the pluge with my dremel and remove the 2242 from the Orico case (I had
looked at a take apart online and it seemed simple enough). Mine didn't want to
come out of the case readily and I ended up having to destroy the usb to m.2
carrier board with a screw driver getting it out so I wouldn't recommend it, but
I was excited to be all scientific and test exactly the same drive in the new
enclosure.

The NVMe drive performed exceptionally well, scoring an 18,500 on
[pibenchmarks.com](https://pibenchmarks.com/search/kayanite/) with no
overclocking (which can evidently
[further increase drive performance](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/overclocking-raspberry-pi-compute-module-4)).
I was truly delighted. Suddenly, my monthly update tasks would take mere
seconds, while the tasks I actully used the pi for would continue running the
same as always‚Äîlargely unnoticed. It was _perfect_.

I did a little further testing with the CM4 disks. The CM4 doesn't have USB 3
(it exposese the PCIe lane for other use which allows the m.2, whereas the pi4b
uses the PCIe lane for USB 3). As a result, the Orico drive over USB was _much_
slower, running over usb-storage instead of uasp, and logging a paltry 3,095 in
my pibenchmark test.

Overall, the CM4 turned out to be a great option for use with a single,
'internal' disk, but not a great choice for a machine that needs to be used with
multiple/external usb disks.

## CM4 Alternatives

I really enjoyed getting to know the CM4. The carrier board market has exploded
over recent years, and benefitted substantially from the competition (especially
from the consumer's point of view). I use the BTT Pico for my 3D printers, and
the form factor of the Mini Base Board is ideal‚ÄîI can mount it directly under
the MCU with standard pi mounting holes. I adore the m.2 slot. As a user of
Noctua fans, I'm also beside myself to have a full 4 pin fan port. Sure, it's
easy enough to make a small adapter cable for the fans, but it's just one less
thing to handle and I already spend an embarassing amount of time crimping
little tiny cables.

I continued to dig. I kept hearing that pi alternatives had proliferated during
the pandemic, and I wondered if I could find a more affordable better performing
board. I tried the BTT CB1, but I hadn't read the documentation carefully enough
before purchasing it: it doesn't have PCIe, and is therefore incapable of using
the higher speed storage. I did find it pretty easy to download and setup the
BTT provided images, but stopped after benchmarking the SD card.

I next tried the Core3566 module. Since the WaveShare baseboards were promoted
to work with it, I thought I might be in luck.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get any of the LuckFox provided images to work. It was
a little strange to be downloading them from a Google Drive file (!?!). They all
errored out when I tried to use them with Etcher. I never got the Core3566
booted, other than in rom mode, which involved trusting the luckfox tool with
sudo, not great. In all fairness, it may just be setup really poorly in terms of
MacOS, and maybe I should try buring one of the images from an rpi, but, after a
couple of hours I threw in the towel. It's probably worth another go 'round:
although sbc-bench doesn't test the Core3566 itself, other 3566 processor based
boards perform just shy of the pi4b/CM4.

## ùúã Œ† œñ ùö∑ ‚Ñø

Somewhere along the way, tumbling further and further down a seemingly
bottomless hole of mildly to extravagently over-priced and under-powered
hardware, I had an inkling that some newer hardware must be just around the
corner. I scoured the rurmormills. All indications pointed to the Pi 5 not
coming out till later next year. So naturally, later in the week after I had
just been busy ordering more 3 year old CM4s and base board from China, news of
the pi 5 struck. While it would have been easy to feel a sense of
disappointment, I relegated myself to the understanding that it was more like
when I give up on the bus and start walking and it immediately comes over the
hill: that my giving up was the causality of the product drop.

It's easy to concede that the Pi5 is a good improvement over its predecessor,
but I can't say that I'm enamored, at least on specs alone. Sure, doubling the
processor speed (according to results on, you guessed it, sbc-bench) is a
welcome change at a pretty low price bump from earlier models. But not including
an m.2 slot on board is just a giant miss, especially considering that the last
NVMe drive I purchased was cheaper than a comparably sized sd card ($9.99 for
the NVMe disk vs $14.99 for the sd card on amazon).

While I'm also unhappy that the new pi still uses the bulkier usb a plugs, I'm
even more upset at what's going on in the usb pd arena with the sbc market in
general. For people who use sbcs to integrate with mcus, switching to usbc pd
3.1 is going to be a game changer. Being able to just plug toolhead and control
boards into the usbc pd 3.1 port and have the sbc handle the power management
side has to happen. Even if it didn't integrate pd 3.1, at least seeing the pi
use something other than the god awful 5a@5v that it choose would be welcome.
Yes, I know it's technically in the pd spec, but it's so uncommon it just
doesn't seem like a good choice.

I was also hoping to see a solid PIO design on the Pi5, so I could do things
like use CAN without having to suffer through the current adapter board
situation. PIO is, for me at least, by far the most interesting thing Rpi has
done to date. It's the feature that sets the company apart. I've been using it
with Kevin O'Connor's CAN software and it's _amazing_. Even though the Pi5 does
include some PIO functionality, it seems like it's a little more paired down and
not as fully embraced as I would have hoped.

I get it, the Pi5 isn't really designed for me and my needs. It feels like it's
made more to target retirees (think grandpad) and users in developing markets,
and I can truly appreciate that stance. The world needs well performing machines
at all levels. However, as someone who uses the pi exclusively headlessly, I
would prefer less of an emphasis on graphics, and more focus on power management
and I/O.

So it sounds like I need to keep waiting for the Rpi CM5 to drop. But if it
specs out the same as the Pi5, I'd rather have the CM4 alternative everyone is
anxiously waiting for: the Radxa CM5. If its core3588 is any indicator, it
should perform at about 3 times the speed of the pi4b, and outpace even the new
pi5 by 50%. I'm anxious to see how it's priced, but I'll probably have to try
one.
