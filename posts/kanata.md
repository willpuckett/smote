I've been using [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) for a few months now... I switched to it from [KMonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad) when I changed computers earlier this year. I expected the two packages to be fairly similar, which has been largely the case, until this morning, when I finally read some documentation and worked through a more complete implementation of my keymap. That, and of course Kanata is way cooler since it's written in Rust. ðŸ¦€

## Installing

Installing Kanata proved to be much easierâ€”it's packaged in [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and can be installed with a simple `brew install kanata`. I had been forced to build kmonad and don't work in Haskell, so prebuilt binaries was a welcome change. 

After installation, I created the following `lanuchctl` job:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>KeepAlive</key>
	<false/>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>org.custom.kanata</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/opt/homebrew/bin/kanata</string>
		<string>--cfg</string>
		<string>/Users/me/Library/Application Support/kanata/kanata.kbd</string>
	</array>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Because I'm lazy and have a bad memory for `launchctl` commands, I added an alias to my `.zshrc` to make cycling the task easier (I don't have to jump back and forth between my editor and [LaunchControl](https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/)):

```sh
alias kanata-restart='sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.custom.kanata'
```

I probably had to do a security-authorizy thing somewhere along the way... A procedure which will need to be repeated if `homebrew` upgrades your `kanata` installation...

## Initial Configuration

I started out with Kanata's [home-row-mod-advanced.kbd](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/9c5ccb762fb37106305ca2f3702daa0f3267fcb1/cfg_samples/home-row-mod-advanced.kbd#L22) example. It did a great job of getting me going with home row mods that felt pretty good. 

Unfortunately, I didn't understand that the `tap-hold-release-keys` key list needed to be a list of unmodified keys. Correcting that helped a bunch. I also needed a few/50 extra milliseconds on my timings.

I didn't want Kanata to modify input from my mech board, so I filtered the devices to only modify the internal keyboard:

```lisp
  macos-dev-names-include (
    "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad"
  )
  ```

  I anticipate reworking my internal board before I got my laptop, so I opted for the ISO keyboard model to have a better feeling left pinky key. I wasn't able to find an ISO defsrc example keyboard with the key named, however, after some searching, I was able to find [a thread](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/discussions/1066) which refers to the 102nd key as `lsgt`, or just `102d`.

## Combos

I was delighted to discover Kanata's support for combos. I implemented them quickly upon discoveryâ€”so much so that I overlooked that they were implemented in two versions and just went with the first one in the documentation. 

`chordsv1` involve making a lot of extra aliases and then configuring them in groups. I used them for several months and they weren't awful, but there was no `require-prior-idle` concept for them, so they only worked well on non-bigram combos.

> The more you know...

This morning, I decided to look further into the issue and discovered `chordsv2` which implements an rpi for all combos. This opened up the combo positions considerably, and has allowed me to achieve parity with my mech board. 

## A Working Caster Config

Here's today's version of the [Caster Layout](https://cyanophage.github.io/magic?layout=bfdlq-pouyjcstrzxnaihkvgmw%5C%2F.%2C%27%3B%3De&mode=ergo&lan=english) (Befuddle Variant) implemented in Kanata.

```lisp
;; Home row mods QWERTY example with more complexity.
;; Some of the changes from the basic example:
;; - when a home row mod activates tap, the home row mods are disabled
;;   while continuing to type rapidly
;; - tap-hold-release helps make the hold action more responsive
;; - pressing another key on the same half of the keyboard
;;   as the home row mod will activate an early tap action

## Outro

I ran into a couple of snags along the way. I tried to implement several 4 key combos (`chordsv2` in Kanata parlance). The larger combos work surprisingly well in some positionsâ€”and not at all in others. I don't think this is Kanata's fault; I would assume it's a keymatrix thing? Although I'm not even sure how this board is implemented. 

The vertical combos are not pressable for me with a single finger, but I still appreciate having them match my mech.

Until our robot overlords type for us!
