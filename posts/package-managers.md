A _Package Manager_ is a piece of software that automates the downland and
install process for other software. Many operating systems (and some
applications!) come with their own package managers. Other operating systems
have third party package managers that can be easily installed and drastically
expedite and simplify your install processes.

### [_**homebrew**_](https://brew.sh/)

A great package manager for OS X is _**homebrew**_. You can install it by
typing:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

into your terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app).

### _**Windows Package Managers**_

There are several package managers available for windows. Windows 10 includes a
package manager called oneget. There is a great article for setting up oneget
[here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AptGetForWindowsOneGetAndChocolateyOnWindows10.aspx).

[_**Chocolatey**_](https://chocolatey.org/) is a package manager for windows 7
and above. You can install it by following
[these instruction](https://chocolatey.org/install).

### _**Other Package Managers**_

Linux comes in many variants. Most variants include their own package manager.
The package manager for _**Debian**_ one of the oldest variants of Linux, is
called _**apt-get**_. Some other very popular package managers are _**yum**_,
_**rpm**_, _**pacman**_, and _**portage**_.

Some _languages_ have a package manager as well. _Ruby_'s package manager is
called _**gem**_. _Node_'s package manager is called _**npm**_. _Python_'s
package manager is called _**pip**_, or, if you are using Python3, _**pip3**_.
