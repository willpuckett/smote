A panoptic history of the past roughly 200 years in communications, Charles
Petzold’s
_[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://books.apple.com/us/book/code/id850460676)_
tells the story of man’s need to transmit information through the ages. Petzold
beautifully relates Semaphore, Telegraph, and TTY to our modern lives, helping
us realize that the thing that’s changed most isn’t how we communicate, but
merely the _speed_ of the signals.
