A panoptic history of the past roughly 200 years in communications, Charles Petzold’s *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://books.apple.com/us/book/code/id850460676)* tells the story of man’s need to transmit information through the ages. Petzold beautifully relates Semaphore, Telegraph, and TTY to our modern lives, helping us realize that the thing that’s changed most isn’t how we communicate, but merely the *speed* of the signals.
