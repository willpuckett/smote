It has great keyboard support, shows code completion, and does really well with iOS multitasking, which makes it a breeze to open up a book or web tutorial side-by-side with your notebook for learning and experimenting."

Although _Jupyter Notebooks_ can easily be accessed in a web browser, the
process on the iPad gets a little more enjoyable in
[Alex Staravoitau's](https://navoshta.com) beautiful app,
[Juno](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-jupyter/id1315744137?mt=8).

You won't be able to run a notebook server on your iPad, but Juno functions as a
front end to access a server you host either at home or in the cloud. It's also
_very_ easy to get connected to a [CoCalc](https://CoCalc.com) account, or, with
the latest release, a [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) instance.

Juno is like a shallow step into a vast ocean, bringing massive computational
functions to the ease and lightness of iOS. It has great keyboard support, shows
code completion, and does really well with iOS multitasking, which makes it a
breeze to open up a book or web tutorial side-by-side with your notebook for
learning and experimenting. There's no better jumping off point.
