Whether you're crafting scientific research, your child's term paper, or a blog like this one, editing text is a big part of most of our lives. Even when you find something so rhythmically fulfilling about repeatedly pressing arrow and delete keys, it can add up to a big misuse of time.

Although they can be a little uncomfortable at first, getting your fingers on the pulse of text editing will make you a better person, and the more you do it, the faster you'll grow. It's a *domino effect*. As a general rule of thumb, I try to step back and audit myself if I'm pressing an arrow or delete key more than twice in a row.

Happy editing.
