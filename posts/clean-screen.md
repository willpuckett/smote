Long ago, I deleted Safari from my iPhone, but since I started using my iPad, I have switched back to Apple's venerable browser. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to re-download Safari to my iPhone other than doing a Factory Reset. But even when I restored from my backup, it deleted Safari again (wasn't *too* surprisedâ€”that is what a backup is *supposed* to do). So, I did something that's probably good to periodically do anyway, and reinstalled all my apps. 

In the process, I picked a new background and then realized it was really nice to see the background when my phone was unlocked, so I put all the apps in a couple of folders in the dock and kept the home screen *completely empty*. 

This makes everything accessible with my thumb which is super convenient, and encourages me to use Siri more. It also lets me enjoy the Live Wallpaper which I find really beautiful. I liked it so much, I did the same thing to my iPad!
