This is 28BYJ-48.

It can be purchased for 61Â¢ on aliexpress, and probably less in quantity. It is
small and features a 1:64 gear reduction utilizing 5 tiny plastic gears. By all
accounts, it is a cheap, unexceptional motor.

I was introduced to 28BYJ-48 through the Hookup's
[Motorize and Automate Your Blinds for $10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O_1gUFumQM)
video, which I found when realizing that daylight was the most effective alarm
clock for me. I couldn't open my blinds to wake myself when I wasn't yet awake,
and so I needed to employ robotics. The video explained how to bipolar mod the
small motor to more than double torque, and write an arduino sketch to control
the motor remotely.

I was elated by what became my first foray into _cover._

## Cover

Cover moves us from day to night. It is a curtain; it is a blanket we pull over
ourselves. Cover nestles us. It is how we go from inside to outside. Cover spans
the region between two ends, usually OPEN and CLOSED. Some covers can only be at
one end or the other, but often, cover can be somewhere in between. As I began
to work more profoundly with cover, I found myself wondering,

> How do you know where home is?

For cover to function, it has to be able to find its ends. Some covers have a
switch at both ends, while others use a single endstop with a hand calibrated
number of steps between the ends, to establish their range. Still others might
not use any probed endstops at all, relying on the motor to 'skip steps' in
order to resynchronize position.

## TMC2209

My first blinds were controlled by A4988 drivers, known for loud operation. To
make my morning transition into wakefulness smoother, I switched to a slient
motor driver, TMC2208. Life was pretty good with the silent driver, but 2208 was
eventually surpassed in popuarity by its successor...

2209 includes _StealthChop_, the same quiet operating mode as 2208, but also
features _StallGuard_ and _CoolStep_. These modes use motor coil feedback to
detect stalls and improve motor power efficency. Stall detection was rapidly
implemented in 3d printing firmwares, but received almost no attention in the
home automation community. I was very interested in using StallGuard endstops in
my Cover applications. It seemed like such a natural pairing.

So it was a relief in 2023 when I found
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/lumascet/a5c48c3dc1ceab02f714735f8811b1caf)
outlining UART control of TMC2209. Until that time, steppers in the DIY home
automation community were controlled only through STEP/DIR interfaces, which
couldn't configure the more advanced features of newer drivers.

Grabbing a breadboard, I wired up a stepstick, Xiao, and 28BYJ-48. Tuning
StallGuard always involves _some_ back and forth to get a motor working well in
its designed application, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get 2209 to
reliably detect stalls on the tiny motors. As I read and reread the datasheet,
it became more and more clear to me that I needed to resize the sense resistors.
I recall running across notes indicating that StallGuard measurments could
become unreliable or just not possible at low drive currents. It seemed the back
emf current I was trying to measure was not a substantial enough portion of the
range the boards were designed for and there wasn't enough signal.

Seasons passed. I had hoped to work out stall sensing with 28BYJ-48 by winter,
if it was even possible, when I planned to use it to control our
[aging wall heater](https://www.printables.com/model/777753-wall-heater-tamer-using-stoplight-controller).
Although I was uncertain if larger sense resistors would allow a stall
measurement, I had to try and eventually drafted the first revison of
[ðŸš¦ StopLight](https://github.com/willpuckett/stoplight). I landed on a very
minimal approach to the board, opting to access most features over UART, made
possible by this
[incredible TMC2209 implementation](https://github.com/slimcdk/esphome-custom-components),
which also allowed me to experiment with IPG (integrated pulse generation),
meaning I didn't need to bother wiring the STEP/DIR interface at all.

There are often cautionary words spoken when it comes to StallGuard and geared
steppers. For good reason: repeatedly ramming a gear train to a sudden stop from
full speed can be damaging. The perceived fragility of the plastic gears *may* be
advantageous in absorbing some of the shock? It's possible that the gearing may
turn out to be a problem, but by the same token, I've run the steppers in stall
conditions for longer durations as part of the their normal homing operation for many
years with no adverse effects.

The boards arrived and StallGuard is working reliably with 28BYJ-48. The
[first batch](https://octule.com/listing/1891073906/stoplight) is intended more
as a POC, but I'm excited to move forward with a few improvements to make it
more robust. I included a PD Controller (HUSB238), so the boards can raise the
voltage before moving the stepper, then return to 5v for idle, which helps keep
the onboard temp sensor (dallas DS18B20) reading more accurate. I hope this
cheap, easy way to move and home a large variety of household elements can make
automated daylighting more accessible. If the average home has 15 windows,
ðŸš¦StopLight could result in over $2,000 of savings compared to the other smart
window shades.
