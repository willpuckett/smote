Exploring layouts for my new and decided to give the [Engram Layout](https://engram.dev) by Arno Klein a go. 

The Keyman App reccommended on the Engram website doesn't work with newer versions of MacOS, so I threw together a keymap for [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org). You can try it out [here](https://smote.io/static/engram.json) (place the json file in `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/` and maybe restart Karabiner).

I'm definitely seeing my fingers moving less, and the punctuation feels very convenient for JavaScript/TypeScript.
