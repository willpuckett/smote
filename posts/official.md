Once I started to realize how much I was going to want my iPad with me, I knew I couldn't just stuff it into any old back pack. I needed a lesser bag, to demonstrate how little I needed to carry. I wanted something that felt *casual*. Something I could throw over a shoulder and be off with. Something that spoke to the sense of unencumberedness that I get from the iPad itself. *I wanted a fanny pack.*

After searching around for a while, I settled on the [Melrose Chest Utility Bag](https://theofficialbrand.com/collections/bags/chest-bags) in black. It had the primary advantage of actually being large enough to accommodate the iPad (I have the 11"). I didn't like the 4 strap chest strap so I repurposed a spare belt I had and wear it either around my waist or (more often) over a single shoulder. It's the perfect size for my iPad with folio keyboard, charger, headphones, and an assortment of pencils. I can usually squeeze a cookie and a puffy jacket in as well so I can be out all day with it.

Of course, now that I'm writing this post I can see that there's a tri-strap model that would probably have been more comfortable for me, as well as lots of other colors I could have checked out. Should have checked the website out before I purchased, but oh well, the tri-strap isn't large enough anyways. This bag is super comfortable to wear on my skateboard and holds everything I need so it's still a win.

A long time ago I switched all my calls to Google Voice, so once I installed Google Hangouts, I was able to remove my [sim](https://www.mintmobile.com/product/03-month-large-sim-card-plan/) from my phone and and pop it into the iPad. Errr, *not so fast*. I was using Google Authenticator on my phone and hadn't saved the authenticator bar codes. It took a week or so to go through disabling 2FA on several accounts (some of them required photos with weird signs etc), but I finally got them all turned off and swapped over to the iPad (where I was sure to save the new 2FA barcodes in case I ever had to go through that again).

Also picked up a stick-on [iPad Camera Lens Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Camera-Protector-Toughened-Lenses-12-9-inch/dp/B07KTK91J8) so I woulndn't break the camera like I did on my phone. Hopefully.
