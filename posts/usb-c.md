There are so many things to complain about in this world, I feel guilty addressing the difficulty I have charging all my devices, but it really had turned into a complicated mess this summer. Particularly problematic was my skateboard, which I love to travel with but often have to bring along a huge transformer.

So one day I happened onto [this thread](https://forum.esk8.news/t/usb-c-for-charging/13354) about using a small DC-to-DC boost converter with a USB C power block to charge your deck. There's a lot of much smaller USB C blocks on the market now that are Gallium Nitride (GaN). They run cool and are way smaller than the older blocks that are included with everything we buy.

USB C has grown to accommodate several voltages all in one plug. It now puts out 5, 9, 12, 15, and 20 volts on the heavier duty adapters. A [USC C PD trigger](https://www.amazon.com/Type-C-Trigger-Module-Supports-Output/dp/B08681N9VV) will allow you to select a voltage from your USB C adapter, then solder (or screw in if you get the one with terminals) to the pads and connect the power to a plug or transformer for other voltages.

## Ideals

In an ideal world, I'd be able to put a single power block and a single cable in my bag, and be able to charge everything: my iPad, my phone, my skateboard, my AirPods, my battery. I travel a lot (at least I did pre-COVID), and having to comb a hotel room for small adapters and dongles before I leave is an opportunity to lose something critical. Small pieces are also more likely to fall out of an improperly zipped bag on the go, so I just really try to avoid them.

John Gruber has some [interesting speculation](https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/third_party_usb-c_to_lightning_cables) about when Apple may depart from the lightning port, but it still doesn't look like anytime soon. Instead of carrying around a USB C to lightning adapter, I threw a couple of Qi pads around the house and added a [Qi receiver](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charger-Charging-Receiver-Compatible/dp/B08HMX7Y3C) to my geriatric iPhone. 

The Qi receiver and a big dual Qi mat on my nightstand alleviated a lot of stress around charging and cables. Not having cables makes not having to carry as many cables way more accessible. Qi has improved dramatically, and has big plans to continue improving over the next several years to do heavier loads for things like kitchen equipment. My solar battery has a Qi mat in it as well, so I've been able to get rid of the lightning cables all together and only have to carry my USB C wall block, a USB C cable, and my Qi enabled USB C battery, which I would generally carry anyway.

Ultimately, I'm only dealing with all these different ports because I've bought things with them, so it's partially about stopping buying products with different ports and centralizing to USB C and Qi.

## Installing

There are two practical ways to install a USB C PD trigger:

1. Crack the device case and install the trigger inside the case.
2. Create a dongle to house the trigger and barrel plug.

Installing the trigger inside the device housing is deeply preferable when possible, but some devices just really aren't designed to be opened, and a small dongle can be more pragmatic. Luckily, the trigger puts out practically no heat, and can easily be encased in molded material (a process called insert molding). 


I cracked the case on my skateboard, but there wasn't room for the smaller boost transformer I still needed to jump from 20v to 45v inside, so I siliconed it back up, and just used a small piece of the original cable to go from the transformer to the board. While not ideal, it drastically reduces my charger size. I can usually find a higher wattage USB C laptop charger at most friend's houses as well, which really helps with range anxiety.
